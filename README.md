# IBD-GCA-model
An Identical-By-Descent(IBD) refined General Combining Ability(GCA) model for genomic selection
As the large amount of genomic data can be generated by deep sequencing technology, genomic selection becomes important for plant breeding. In genomic selection model, utilizing the relationship between training population and test population can help to improve selection accuracy, here we attempt to identify Identical-By-Descent regions on genome between test population and training population, and to integrate these IBD information to genomic selection model to explore the possibility for improving prediction accuracy.
